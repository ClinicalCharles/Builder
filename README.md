Builder
=======
This is a Form builder that I made as part of a project at work. The scope of the application is beyond just a form builder as it can create and configure an JSX components so long as they have a sensible prop structure.

The app was built with a combination of react-dnd, redux, react-hot-loader, webpack, babel, react-undo and immutable js.

To run: clone the repository, npm install, npm start, navigate to localhost:3000.

You can interact with the demo [here](http://clinicalcharlesbuilder.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/)

I will try to provide documentation at some point.

Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.
